  summary: | 
    Principal engineer and architect of a project to build a REST API from the ground up. The Flask-restx API was a personal 
    project that my team adopted and grew to fit the needs of the organization. The API provides access via ODBC and sqlAlchemy with a 
    simple to use configuration model where endpoints can be deployed with a simple yaml config file that defines arguments, 
    optional custom functions, stored procedures, and much more.It has become the backbone of a greater project that has spawned 
    multiple web portals, driven analytics, provided microservices, and even enabled access to an a difficult application by layering a REST
    API on top of the SOAP API for that application. The repo provided is a watered down version of my original project that has been approved
    to be shared. (Minus security/authentication, etc)
