  summary: | 
    Built a Flask API from the ground up to learn Python, but ended up using it at my company because we didn't have an
    API before. The API included advanced logging handlers, token authorization, Response() object handling, and a simple 
    config endpoint model. The model allows endpoints to be deployed with a simple config file that identifies the route, query, 
    stored procedure, parameters, custom function, and more.
