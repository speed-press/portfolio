# a summary about you
summary: |
  An accomplished leader in the data and software engineering space by trade. Some may
  consider me the perfect reverse engineer, but really I'm just an avid learner at heart. 
  I have a passion to understand, resolve, fortify, and create. Deconstructing things into 
  its component parts and learning the nuances of each is what I do as a hobby.
  
  That passion transfers directly into my work where I tend to question the norm, 
  push the boundaries, and drive innovation. Everything becomes a puzzle and problem solving
  becomes more fun the more complex it is. It's OCD like behavior. It's the itch that must be scratched. 
  
  
  Throw me in the fire. I'll come out with a solution.
